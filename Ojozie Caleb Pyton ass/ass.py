    # Question 1
    print("1. What are the key differences between primitive data types and ADTs?")
    print("Answer:")
    print("- Primitive data types are basic built-in types such as int, float, bool, and char.")
    print("- Abstract Data Types (ADTs) are user-defined models like stacks, queues, and lists that specify what operations can be done, not how they are implemented.\n")

    # Question 2
    print("2. Why are arrays considered static, and linked lists dynamic?")
    print("Answer:")
    print("- Arrays are static because their size is fixed when created and cannot grow or shrink.WHILE")
    print("- Linked lists are dynamic because nodes can be added or removed at runtime without needing a fixed size.\n")

    # Question 3
    print("3. In what situations would you prefer a linked list over an array?")
    print("Answer:")
    print("- When you need frequent insertions and deletions.")
    print("- When memory is limited or unpredictable.")
    print("- When the size of the data is not known beforehand.\n")

    # Question 4
    print("4. Real-world examples where each structure would be useful:")
    
    print("\n   o Stack:")
    print("     - Undo/redo buttons in apps.")
    print("     - Browser back button.")
    print("     - Expression evaluation (e.g., calculators).")
    
    print("\n   o Queue:")
    print("     - Waiting line in banks.")
    print("     - Printer job scheduling.")
    print("     - Customer service ticketing systems.")
    
    print("\n   o Linked List:")
    print("     - Music playlists that allow easy insertion/removal.")
    print("     - Navigation through a photo gallery.")
    print("     - Implementing browser forward/backward history.\n")
